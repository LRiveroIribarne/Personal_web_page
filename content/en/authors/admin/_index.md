test 5. I studied agricultural engineering motivated by learning how plant species work and how they are affected by climate change. Since then, I have been involved in many projects related to both agricultural and natural systems, first doing my bachelor thesis using remote sensing tools and water flow modelling to compute crop coefficients in Avocado plantations. Then as a research assistant in projects related to watershed hydrology, monitoring ecosystems that are being modulated both by climate change impacts and human impacts.  

Currently, I am doing a master's in geo-information science to go further into both physical and statistical modelling of agro and ecosystems to develop data-driven solutions to confront incoming global change impacts using geographic information systems, remote sensing, scripting, in situ sensors, data science and Big Data techniques. So, if you have any job offer in that way do not hesitate to contact me :)
